Viscomp Competition Readme
--------------------------

The files provided in the development kit are to help you get started with the competition.

Here are the contents of each file:
 - classes.mat: Contains a cell array with the name of the object classes used in the competition
 - computeAP.m: Function to compute average precision (AP) in Matlab (for example usage, see demo_val.m)
 - createUploadFile.m: Given the list of image names, list of classes, and a matrix with the confidence values, this function generates the file to be uploaded to the viscomp evaluation server (this is your FINAL result; for example usage, see demo_upload.m)
 - demo_upload.m: This file contains example usage of 'createUploadFile' function. It creates a random confidence matrix in this case (i.e. very low performance in general). Remember to upload the 'dataset_folder' variable before running.
 - demo_val.m: This file contains example usage of 'computeAP' function on validation data. You can run this file to see the average precision for each of the classes used in the dataset. This function may take some time to run as it loads all the validation data annotation. Remember to update the 'dataset_folder' variable before running.
 - filelists.mat: Contains three structures, 'train_data', 'test_data', 'val_data': each of these structures contain the list of files in each of the given sets of images (i.e. train, test and validation). To access the actual file, you need to concatenate this with the 'dataset_folder'.
 - readUploadFile.m: Function used to read the upload file created by 'createUploadFile' back into Matlab.
 - sample_upload.txt: Sample file to show format of file to be uploaded to the server (this file can be re-generated by running demo_upload.m).
 - VOCreadxml.m: Function for reading the XML annotation files provided in the dataset (see demo_upload.m or demo_val.m for example usage).

Note that we do not describe all files as there may be some auxillary functions that are called by the functions above. You can ignore them in general, or start from the calling function to get an idea of what they are useful for.
